Ascential
==============================


1. Clone repo into a local directory called 'Ascential', alongside a subdirectory called 'Projects'.
2. 'Projects' should contain directories such as 'Cannes', or 'SpringAutumnFair'.
3. Individual projects should hold reports, powerpoints, but also a directory called 'Data'
4. 'Data' should contain a 'Raw', 'Interim', and 'Processed' directory.
5. Raw should never be changed physically. Interim contains cleaned data etc. Processed is transformed/analysable.
6. Allows you to simultaneously work on multiple projects with multiple data sources in the same place.
7. Can commit to GitHub without worrying about transferring data - any files called 'data' in 'Code' are invisible.

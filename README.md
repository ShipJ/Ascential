Ascential
==============================


1. Clone repo into a local directory called 'Ascential', alongside a subdirectory called 'Projects'.
2. 'Projects' should contain all related documents, and a path to whatever data source(s) is relevant.
3. Allows you to simultaneously work on multiple projects with multiple data sources in the same place.
4. Can commit to GitHub without worrying about transferring data - anything outside 'Code' is invisible.
